    <strong>Kode Mono</strong> is a <strong>variable monospaced</strong> typeface designed specifically for the
    developer
    community. Its key feature is clarity and functionality, making it ideal for coding environments where legibility
    is crucial. The font includes ligatures, which are combinations of multiple characters into a single glyphâ€”helpful
    in improving the readability of common programming symbols in languages like JavaScript, Python, Haskell, and Rust.
